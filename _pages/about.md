# About me

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at Zhejiang University under the supervision of [Prof. Jinsong Han](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/hanjinsong) and [Prof. Zhiguo Wan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8D7Vh20AAAAJ&hl=en). I also work closely with [Prof. Yang Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QkzqbckAAAAJ&hl=en) from Singapore Management University.

My research interests include ***Distributed security/privacy*** and ***Applied Cryptography***.
